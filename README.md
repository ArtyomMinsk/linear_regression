# Signs of Regression

Linear Regression with a Python module `scikit-learn` for machine learning.

## Description

This project is about supervised machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression) that uses labeled data to predict outputs based on inputs. Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Equation form is  `y=aâˆ—x+b`, where  `x`  is the explanatory variable (variable being used) and `y` is the dependent variable (variable being predicted). The slope of the line is `a`, and `b` is the intercept (the value of `y` when `x=0`).

## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to:

- Be able to use scikit-learn to perform linear regression
- Understand single-variable and multiple-variable linear regression
